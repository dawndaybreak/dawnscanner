          message = "The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails 1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks. NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380. It has been reviewed in 2012 and it affects also 2.3.x, 3.0.x and 3.1.x."
